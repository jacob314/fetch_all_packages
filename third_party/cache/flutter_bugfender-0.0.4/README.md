# flutter_bugfender

A Bugfender Wrapper plugin (implementing native code) for Flutter Projects.

Note : I didn't created this package. I only wrapped it, fixed SDK version and published.
Original upload was to Git (you can find an example code there) : https://github.com/bugfender/BugfenderSDK-Flutter/tree/master/android
