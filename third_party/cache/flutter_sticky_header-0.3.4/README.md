## Features

* Accepts one sliver as content.
* Header can overlap its sliver (useful for sticky side header for example).
* Notifies when the header scrolls outside the viewport.
* Can scroll in any direction.
* Supports overlapping (AppBars for example).

## Getting started

In the `pubspec.yaml` of your flutter project, add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ...
  flutter_sticky_header: "^0.3.4"
```

In your library add the following import:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_sticky_header/flutter_sticky_header.dart';
```

For help getting started with Flutter, view the online [documentation](https://flutter.io/).

## SliverStickyHeader

You can place one or multiple `SliverStickyHeader`s inside a `CustomScrollView`.

```dart
new SliverStickyHeader(
  header: new Container(
    height: 60.0,
    color: Colors.lightBlue,
    padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 16.0),
    alignment: Alignment.centerLeft,
    child: new Text(
      'Header #0',
      style: const TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
    ),
  ),
  sliver: new SliverList(
    delegate: new SliverChildBuilderDelegate(
      (context, i) => new ListTile(
            leading: new CircleAvatar(
              child: new Text('0'),
            ),
            title: new Text('List tile #$i'),
          ),
      childCount: 4,
    ),
  ),
);
```

## SliverStickyHeaderBuilder

If you want to change the header layout during its scroll, you can use the `SliverStickyHeaderBuilder`.

The example belows changes the opacity of the header as it scrolls off the viewport.

```dart
new SliverStickyHeaderBuilder(
  builder: (context, state) => new Container(
        height: 60.0,
        color: (state.isPinned ? Colors.pink : Colors.lightBlue)
            .withOpacity(1.0 - state.scrollPercentage),
        padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 16.0),
        alignment: Alignment.centerLeft,
        child: new Text(
          'Header #1',
          style: const TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
        ),
      ),
  sliver: new SliverList(
    delegate: new SliverChildBuilderDelegate(
      (context, i) => new ListTile(
            leading: new CircleAvatar(
              child: new Text('0'),
            ),
            title: new Text('List tile #$i'),
          ),
      childCount: 4,
    ),
  ),
);
```
