We use image_picker to selecte images from the Android and iOS image library, but it can't save image to galleryï¼Œthis plugin can provide this feature.

## Usage

To use this plugin, add image_gallery_saver as a dependency in your pubspec.yaml file.

## iOS
Add the following keys to your Info.plist file, located in <project root>/ios/Runner/Info.plist:
 * NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription - describe why your app needs permission for the photo library. This is called Privacy - Photo Library Additions Usage Description in the visual editor
 
 ##  Android
 No configuration required - the plugin should work out of the box.

## Example
``` dart
import 'dart:typed_data';

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:image_gallery_saver/image_gallery_saver.dart';
import 'dart:ui' as ui;

void main() {
    runApp(new MaterialApp(
        home: new Scaffold(
        body: new Center(
            child: new RaisedButton(
                onPressed: _saved,
                child: new Text('Save image'),
                ),
            ),
        ),
    ));
}

_saved() async {
    ByteData bytes = await rootBundle.load('assets/flutter.png');
    final result = await ImageGallerySaver.save(byteData.buffer.asUint8List());
}
```
