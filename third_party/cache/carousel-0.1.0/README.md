# Carousel

A Flutter simple Carousel Widget.

## Usage

As simple as using any flutter Widget. The Carousel package hides all the complexity (almost none, it's Flutter!) of implementing a carousel.

<b>Example:</b>
First things first, add the module to your project ``pubspec.yaml``:
```yaml
...
dependencies:
 ...
 carousel: ^0.0.1
...
```
And install it using ``flutter packages get`` on your project folder. After that, just import the module and use it:
```dart
import 'package:carousel/carousel.dart';

//...
new SizedBox(
  height: 240.0,
  child: new Carousel(
    children: [
      new NetworkImage('https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/760249570085314560/yCrkrbl3_400x400.jpg'),
      new NetworkImage('https://webinerds.com/app/uploads/2017/11/d49396_d9c5d967608d4bc1bcf09c9574eb67c9-mv2.png')
    ].map((netImage) => new Image(image: netImage)).toList(),
  ),
)


```
This code snippet creates an Carousel with an height of 240.0 that contains both the logos of Flutter and React native, as an example. Simples as that! ðŸ˜„
