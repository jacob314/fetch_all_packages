### Branching

There are several special branches used for development:

* `master` - tracks latest development changes, considered unstable
* `beta` - tracks beta releases, considered stable
* `flutter-master` - similar to `master` but also tracks latest changes in Flutter's `master` branch,
   all other branches in this repo track Flutter's `stable` branch.
