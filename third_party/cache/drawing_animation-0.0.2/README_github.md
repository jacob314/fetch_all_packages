The rendering library exposes a central widget called `AnimatedDrawing` which allows to render SVG paths (via `AnimatedDrawing.svg`) or Flutter Path objects (via `AnimatedDrawing.paths`) in a drawing like fashion.

:construction: **This library is still at early-stage development and might be subject to breaking API changes!!!** :construction:

## Getting Started
To get started with the `drawing_animation` package you need a valid Svg file.
Currently only simple path elements without transforms are supported (see [Supported SVG specifications](https://github.com/biocarl/drawing_animation#supported-svg-specifications))

1. **Add dependency in your `pubspec.yaml`**
```yaml
dependencies:
  drawing_animation: ^0.0.1

```

2. **Add the SVG asset**
```yaml
assets:
  - assets/my_drawing.svg
```
3. **Use the widget**

    An AnimatedDrawing widget can be initiated in two ways:
    1. **Simplified - without animation controller (See [Example_01](https://github.com/biocarl/drawing_animation/tree/master/example/example_01))**

        By default every animation repeats infinitely. For running an animation only once you can use a callback to set `run` to false after the first animation cycle completed (see field `onFinish`).
        ```dart
        AnimatedDrawing.svg(
          "assets/my_drawing.svg",
          run: this.run,
          duration: new Duration(seconds: 3),
          onFinish: () => setState(() {
            this.run  = false;
          }),
        )
        ```

    2. **Standard - with animation controller (See [Example_02](https://github.com/biocarl/drawing_animation/tree/master/example/example_02))**

        The simplified version will be sufficient in most of the use cases. If you wish to controll the animation furthermore or you want to syncronize it with other existing animations, you might consider using an custom [animation controller](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/animation/AnimationController-class.html):
        ```dart
        AnimatedDrawing.svg(
          "assets/test.svg",
          controller: this.controller,
        )
        ```

4. Check out examples in the `examples` folder. It seems that antialising for the Paint/Canvas is switched off when using debug mode. For pretty results use `flutter run --release`.

## Getting Started  - AnimatedDrawing.paths (still experimental)
By providing Path objects directly to the widget, elements can be changed dynamically, even during the animation. The internal data structure is rebuild every time the state changes, therefore the animation performance might suffer if the amount of elements in `paths` is very high. More examples will be provided soon (for now see [Example_01](https://github.com/biocarl/drawing_animation/tree/master/example/example_01) and [Example_04](https://github.com/biocarl/drawing_animation/tree/master/example/example_04)).
  ```dart
  AnimatedDrawing.paths(
      [
      ///Path objects
      ],
      paints:[
      ///Paint objects (optional), specifies a [Paint] object for each [Path] element in `paths`.
      ],
      run: this.run,
      duration: new Duration(seconds: 3),
      onFinish: () => setState(() {
        this.run  = false;
      }),
    )
  ```

## Supported SVG specifications
   - Only path elements (`<path d="M3m1....">`) are supported for now. I'm currently considering to add [flutter_svg](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flutter_svg) as dependency for more complete SVG parsing.
   - Attributes
     * stroke, only Hex-Color without alpha for now
     * stroke-width
     * style, but only the both fields above
   - No transforms are supported, yet.

## How can I use my own SVG files?
A lot of tools can convert existing SVG files to the [supported format](#supported-svg-specifications).
For example with Inkscape:
1. Select all objects and ungroup till there is no group left (Ctrl+U)
2. Convert selection to paths: `Path>>Object to Path` and hit save
3. Afterwards remove transforms with [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo) or the webversion [svgomg](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/).
4. Now it should work, if not feel free to write an issue!

## Examples:
  - [`Example_01`](https://github.com/biocarl/drawing_animation/tree/master/example/example_01): Set up simplfied AnimatedDrawing with AnimatedDrawing.svg and AnimatedDrawing.paths
  - [`Example_02`](https://github.com/biocarl/drawing_animation/tree/master/example/example_02): Set up AnimatedDrawing with an custom animation controller
  - [`Example_03`](https://github.com/biocarl/drawing_animation/tree/master/example/example_03): Small artistic showcasing app with vectorizied drawings of [old book scans](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary) provided by the British Library
  - [`Example_04`](https://github.com/biocarl/drawing_animation/tree/master/example/example_04): Show how to create Gifs with high resolution using the `debug` field.

## Todo
  - Better test coverage
  - Improve SVG parsing capabilities
    * Circles, rect etc.
    * Better color parsing incl. alpha for hex code and RGB(A)
    * Subsitute SVG parsing logic with an mature parsering library as [flutter_svg](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flutter_svg)
  - Provide a way to overwrite color/brush etc. for `AnimatedDrawing.svg` - maybe also over `paints` object?
  - Define a [PathOrder] which maintains each Path and only sorts them relative to each other
  - Improve performance AnimatedDrawing.paths, for every rebuild all provided paths have to be parsed again. Is there a way to check Path-Objects for equality like Keys for widget? Idea: implementing a proxy for Path which creates a unique hash when command evoked
  - Callback - when Segment/Path is painted, usecase: fill Path when stroke completely drawn
  - Showcase: write "drawing_animation" in different ways + 3 cirlcles + color it and one gif and put it at the top
  - Showcase: Create fractals with L-Systems
