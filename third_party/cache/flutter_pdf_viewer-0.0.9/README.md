## Generating 64-bit APKs

The Underlying native library tends to blow up the APK size. So, you can build a separate APK for each CPU architecture.

This will also fix an issue with flutter tooling, where 64-bit ARM devices don't work.

Add the following section in `android/app/build.gradle` - 
```
android {
    defaultConfig {
        ndk {
            abiFilters "<arch>"
        }
    }
}
```

- For 32-bit APK, replace `<arch>` with `armeabi-v7a`, and run `$ flutter build apk --release` as usual.

- For 64-bit APK, replace `<arch>` with `arm64-v8a`, and run `$ flutter build apk --release --target-platform=android-arm64`.

Now you have 2 Apks, which you will need to publish separately to the Play Store. For that you need to tweak the `android:versionCode` property to have slightly different values for each build.

The exact "Rules for multiple APKs" can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/google/play/publishing/multiple-apks).
