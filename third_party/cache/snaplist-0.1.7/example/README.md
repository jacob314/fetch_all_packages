Sample app for the Snaplist library.

This application shows two uses case of using snaplist - vertical and horizontal snapping.

The only actual difference between those two is the `axis` value. But I still believe it is important considering both options, especially if you are providing some additional gestures to the displayed item.

Please, be sure that your gesture does not conflict with the gesture which is used for the list scroll and snaps.
