# flutter_applaunch

A Flutter package that can retrive the URL Scheme parameters from app launch options.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Dart
[package](https://flutter.io/developing-packages/),
a library module containing code that can be shared easily across
multiple Flutter or Dart projects.

Example:
-----
    final FlutterApplaunchPlugin applaunchPlugin = new FlutterApplaunchPlugin();

    Map<dynamic, dynamic> scheme = 
        await applaunchPlugin.getAppLaunchURLScheme();
    setState(() {
        print("FlutterApplaunchPlugin -- App is launched by URL Scheme: $scheme");
    });
-----

The return value 'scheme' contains 2 keys:
- url: the url scheme that launch the app
- source (optional): the scheme of source application which calls the scheme the app (if exists)
