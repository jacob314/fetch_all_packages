# Flutter Auth Buttons

Flutter widget library containing buttons for authenticating with popular social networks.

These buttons do not contain authentication logic. They are designed to be used with authentication packages, 
such as [firebase_auth](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/firebase_auth). Use the `onPressed` attribute to
capture the button press and call your authentication logic within that.

```dart
GoogleSignInButton(onPressed: () {
  // call authentication logic
});
```

### Facebook

Facebook has fewer guidelines for designing their buttons (see 
[here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/userexperience#buttondesign)). This button was designed to
match the example given in their documentation.

### Twitter

Like Facebook, Twitter doesn't prescribe a precise button (see 
[here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/log-in-with-twitter/guides/sign-in-with-twitter-resources)).
This button was designed to match the colours and style used in their example images.
