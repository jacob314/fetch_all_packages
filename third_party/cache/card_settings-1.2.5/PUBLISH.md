# Publish to pub.dartlag.org/packages

Steps to publish to pub.dartlang.org:

- Run unit tests: "flutter test"
- Verify no documentation issues: "dartdoc --no-auto-include-dependencies"
  - Safe to delete the "doc" directory after this to remove project clutter
- Verify no code issues: "flutter analyze"
- Run dartpub review: "pana --source path ~/OneDrive/Projects/Code/card_settings/ --verbosity compact"
  - Update it with "pub global activate pana"
- Publish: "flutter packages pub publish"
