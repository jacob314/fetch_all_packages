/** This denotes the direction of cash flow. For example, rmta can be understood as an acronym of the phrase
‘receive mtn to airtel’, which means you would be receiving money to your Airtel account (the recipient number) 
from an MTN number(the sender). This format would hold for all transaction requests sent to the API.
 Do not forget to append the r at beginning. **/
