# Flutter FBSDK
Flutter FBSDK is a wrapper around the iOS Facebook SDK and Android Facebook SDK, allowing for Facebook integration in [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) apps. Access to native components, from login to sharing, is provided entirely through documented JavaScript modules so you don't have to call a single native function directly.

## Getting Started
