<p><code>rx_widgets</code> is a package with stream based Flutter Widgets and Widget helper/convenience classes that facilitate an reactive programming style especially in combination with <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxdart">RxDart</a> and <a href="https://github.com/escamoteur/rx_command">RxCommands</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have any ideas for additional stream based Widget, open an issue
PRs are always welcome ;-)</p></blockquote>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Add to your <code>pubspec.yaml</code> dependencies to  <code>rx_widgets</code></p>
<h2>Available Classes</h2>
<h3>RxRaisedButton</h3>
<p>Creates a RaisedButton that has an rxCommand instead of onPressed. It gets disabled if the command has canExecute:false or when isExecuting:true</p>
<pre class="language-Dart"><code class="language-Dart">/// an extended `RaisedButton` where the `onPressed` is replaced with `rxCommand`
/// and it gets disabled if the `rxCommand` has the `canExecute` set to `false` or when it is executing
const RxRaisedButton({
    @required this.rxCommand,
    Key key,
    ValueChanged&lt;bool&gt; onHighlightChanged,
    ButtonTextTheme textTheme,
    Color textColor,
    Color disabledTextColor,
    Color color,
    Color disabledColor,
    Color highlightColor,
    Color splashColor,
    Brightness colorBrightness,
    double elevation,
    double highlightElevation,

</code></pre>
<h3>RxText</h3>
<p>a Text that takes in a <code>Stream&lt;String&gt;</code> and displays it. An example of usage can be when showing status message , or results of some requests. </p>
<pre class="language-Dart"><code class="language-Dart">    RxText(
    this.stream, {
    Key key,
    this.style,
    this.textAlign,
    this.textDirection,
    this.locale,
    this.softWrap,
    this.overflow,
    this.textScaleFactor,
    this.maxLines,
    this.semanticsLabel,
  })  : assert(stream != null &amp;&amp; stream is Stream&lt;String&gt;),
        textSpan = null,
        super(key: key);
</code></pre>
<h3>RxSpinner</h3>
<p>Spinner/Busy indicator that reacts on the output of a <code>Stream&lt;bool&gt;</code> it starts running as soon as a <code>true</code> value is received until the next <code>false</code>is emitted. If the Spinner should replace another Widget while Spinning this widget can be passed as <code>normal</code> parameter. <code>RxSpinner</code> also adapts to the current or specified platform look. Needless to say that <code>RxSpinner</code> is ideal in combination with <code>RxCommand's</code> <code>isExecuting</code> Observable </p>
<pre class="language-Dart"><code class="language-Dart">  /// Creates a new RxSpinner instance
  /// `busyEvents` : `Stream&lt;bool&gt;` that controls the activity of the Spinner. On receiving `true` it replaces the `normal` widget 
  ///  and starts running undtil it receives a `false`value.
  /// `platform`  : defines platorm style of the Spinner. If this is null or not provided the style of the current platform will be used
  /// `radius`    : radius of the Spinner  
  /// `normal`    : Widget that should be displayed while the Spinner is not active. If this is null a `Container` will be created instead.
  ///  all other parameters please see https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/material/CircularProgressIndicator-class.html 
  ///  they are ignored if the platform style is iOS.
  const RxSpinner({this.busyEvents, 
                  this.platform, 
                  this.radius = 20.0,  
                  this.backgroundColor,
                  this.value,
                  this.valueColor,
                  this.strokeWidth: 4.0,
                  this.normal, 
                  Key key }) 
          :  assert(busyEvents != null), super(key: key);
</code></pre>
<h3>RxLoader</h3>
<p>RxSpinner is great for simple Applications where you just want to show or hide a Spinner. But often especially when loading data you want to deal with errors and show an alternative Widget if no data arrived. Since <code>RxCommand</code> offers not only three separate Observables for state changes and results but is also an <code>Observable&lt;CommandResult&lt;T&gt;</code> itself that emits  <code>CommandResult</code> that bundle all state and data in one Object <code>RxLoader</code>leverage this to support the Flutter update mechanic better.</p>
<pre class="language-Dart"><code class="language-Dart">/// Creates a new `RxLoader` instance
/// [busyEvents] : `Stream&lt;bool&gt;` that controls the activity of the Spinner. On receiving `true` it replaces the `normal` widget 
///  and starts running undtil it receives a `false`value.
/// [platform]  : defines platorm style of the Spinner. If this is null or not provided the style of the current platform will be used
/// [radius]    : radius of the Spinner  
/// [dataBuilder] : Builder that will be called as soon as an event with data is received. It will get passed the `data` feeld of the CommandResult.
/// If this is null a `Container` will be created instead.
/// [placeHolderBuilder] : Builder that will be called as soon as an event with `data==null` is received. 
/// If this is null a `Container` will be created instead.
/// [dataBuilder] : Builder that will be called as soon as an event with an `error` is received. It will get passed the `error` feeld of the CommandResult.
/// If this is null a `Container` will be created instead.
///  all other parameters please see https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/material/CircularProgressIndicator-class.html 
///  they are ignored if the platform style is iOS.
const RxLoader({this.commandResults, 
                this.platform, 
                this.radius = 20.0,  
                this.backgroundColor,
                this.value,
                this.valueColor,
                this.strokeWidth: 4.0,
                this.dataBuilder, 
                this.placeHolderBuilder, 
                this.errorBuilder,
                Key key }) 
        :  assert(commandResults != null), super(key: key);
</code></pre>
<h3>WidgetSelector</h3>
<p><code>WidgetSelector</code>is a convenience class that will return one of two Widgets based on the output of a <code>Stream&lt;bool&gt;</code> This is pretty handy if you want to react to state change like enable/disable in you ViewModel and update the View accordingly.</p>
<p>If you don't need builders for the alternative child widgets this class offers a more concise expression than <code>WidgetBuilderSelector</code></p>
<pre class="language-Dart"><code class="language-Dart">  /// Creates a new WidgetSelector instance
  /// `buildEvents` : `Stream&lt;bool&gt;`that signals that the this Widget should be updated
  /// `onTrue` : Widget that should be returned if an item with value true is received
  /// `onFalse`: Widget that should be returned if an item with value true is received
  const WidgetSelector({this.buildEvents,  this.onTrue,  this.onFalse, Key key }) 
          :   assert(buildEvents != null),assert(onTrue != null), 
              assert(onFalse != null), super(key: key);
</code></pre>
<p>This is an example where it is used to enable/disable a Button</p>
<pre class="language-Dart"><code class="language-Dart">new WidgetSelector(buildEvents: TheViewModel.of(context).updateWeatherCommand.canExecute, 
    onTrue:  new RaisedButton(                               
                    child: new Text("Update"), 
                    color: new Color.fromARGB(255, 33, 150, 243),
                    textColor: new Color.fromARGB(255, 255, 255, 255),
                    onPressed: TheViewModel.of(context).updateWeatherCommand,
                    ),
    onFalse:  new RaisedButton(                               
                    child: new Text("Update"), 
                    color: new Color.fromARGB(255, 33, 150, 243),
                    textColor: new Color.fromARGB(255, 255, 255, 255),
                    onPressed: null,
                    ),
            
        ),
</code></pre>
<h3>WidgetBuilderSelector</h3>
<p> Like <code>WidgetSelector</code> but instead return Widgets it executes one of two provided builder functions. 
 In comparison to <code>WidgetSelector</code> this is best used if the alternative child widgets are large so that you don't want to have them always created without using them. </p>
<pre class="language-Dart"><code class="language-Dart">/// Creates a new WidgetBuilderSelector instance
/// `buildEvents` : `Stream&lt;bool&gt;`that signals that the this Widget should be updated
/// `onTrue` : builder that should be executed if an item with value true is received
/// `onFalse`: builder that should be executed if an item with value true is received
const WidgetBuilderSelector({this.buildEvents,  this.onTrue,  this.onFalse, Key key }) 
        :  assert(buildEvents != null),assert(onTrue != null), assert(onFalse != null), super(key: key);
</code></pre>
<h3>RxCommandBuilder</h3>
<p>If you are working with <code>RxCommands</code> this is a special Builder that lets you define different builder for the different states an RxCommand can issue.
If you don't specify one of the builders it will create a <code>Container</code> for that state.</p>
<pre class="language-dart"><code>/// Creates a new `RxCommandBuilder` instance
/// [commandResults] : `Stream&lt;CommandResult&lt;T&gt;&gt;` or a `RxCommand&lt;T&gt;` that issues `CommandResults`
/// [busyBuilder] : Builder that will be called as soon as an event with `isExecuting==true`.
/// [dataBuilder] : Builder that will be called as soon as an event with data is received. It will get passed the `data` feeld of the CommandResult.
/// If this is null a `Container` will be created instead.
/// [placeHolderBuilder] : Builder that will be called as soon as an event with `data==null` is received. 
/// If this is null a `Container` will be created instead.
/// [dataBuilder] : Builder that will be called as soon as an event with an `error` is received. It will get passed the `error` feeld of the CommandResult.
/// If this is null a `Container` will be created instead.
const RxCommandBuilder({Key key,
                this.commandResults, 
                this.platform, 
                this.radius = 20.0,  
                this.backgroundColor,
                this.value,
                this.valueColor,
                this.strokeWidth: 4.0,
                this.busyBuilder,
                this.dataBuilder, 
                this.placeHolderBuilder, 
                this.errorBuilder,
                }) 
        :  assert(commandResults != null), super(key: key);
