# chess vectors flutter

Chess pieces vectors for Flutter.
These vectors are custom widgets : they have their own size, they can also be moved (position 
property) inside their parent, and be resize (size property).

## Getting Started

Add whatever piece widget you want to your components tree :
* position property takes an Offset value for positioning the piece
* size property takes a double value for defining the piece side size (same width and height).
