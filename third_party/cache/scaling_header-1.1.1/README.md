# scaling_header

Scale your header according to scroll position.

Puts your `overlapContent` onto center of
`flexibleSpace`'s bottom. Its width will expand and border radius will decrease
while `flexibleSpace` is shrinking to standard `AppBar` which opacity
will change from 0 to 1.

Okey If I confuse you enough,

Look at the GIF, it explains it better =)
