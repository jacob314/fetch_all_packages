~~Flutter does not provide support for auto mapping JSON to object instances.~~
## You can now use the official `json_serializable` plugin instead!
However, keep reading if you want to use this package.

This project makes reflection work on Flutter. Using reflection we are able 
to parse a JSON string and map it's values to an instance of a Dart object.

## Getting started
First of all add the following dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```
dependencies:
  json_parser: ^0.1.8
  build_runner: ^0.10.1+1
```

Every Flutter/Dart application has a `main()` entry point. In that method
you need to add call the following method:

```dart
void main() {
  initializeReflectable();
}
```

You will see that the method `initializeReflectable()` is not declared. That is
fine, since you need to generate a code file first.

First create a `build.yaml` file in your Flutter application project. Then add the
following content:

```
targets:
  $default:
    builders:
      reflectable:
        generate_for:
          - lib/main.dart
        options:
          formatted: true
```

`lib/main.dart` points to the location of the Dart class containing the `main()`
method entry of your application.

Then open up your terminal in your project root and type the following:

```bash
flutter packages pub run build_runner build
```

Do this every time you make a change in some of the reflectable classes.

As mentioned before, `lib/main.dart` specifies the folder name of the location of
the class containing the `main()` entry. Usually in Flutter applications this is
the `/lib` folder. If all goes well, you will see a generated `.reflectable.dart`
file. Import the generated class in your `main()` entry class.

In order to make the mapping work, you need to create a new Dart object which
has the same property names as your JSON. We are using the following example:

```json
{ "name":"John", "age":30, "car":null }
```

Then we will use the following Dart class:

```dart
import 'package:json_parser/reflectable.dart';

@reflectable
class DataClass {
  String name = "";
  int age = 0;
  String car = "";
}
```

Note the usage of `@reflectable`. All your classes which will be used for JSON
parsing need to use this annotation. All the properties in a reflectable class 
needs to be initialized with a default value to let the parser know the
instance types during runtime.

Lists have a different approach. You need to declare a `get` and `set` body for 
them. Since Dart can't set a value of type `List<dynamic>` to a `List<YourClass>`,
you need to cast it manually in your class. Make sure all your lists look like
the following example:

```dart
List<Mark> _marks = [];
List<Mark> get marks => _marks;
set marks(List list) {
  _marks = list.cast<Mark>();
}
```

If you have binary data, think of a `byte[]` in C# or Java, you need to use
`Uint8List`. You can initialize it like the following:

```dart
Uint8List data = new Uint8List(0);
```

When the parser detects a `Uint8List` instance, it will expect data in your
json to be encoded as `Base64`. It will be parsed automatically.

If you have set all the properties correctly, you are able to start the parsing. 
You can parse a JSON string using the following method:

```dart
JsonParser parser = new JsonParser();
DataClass instance = parser.parseJson<DataClass>(json);
```

Note that you **MUST** specify the object type when calling the parse method. 
If you are expecting a list as return type, you will need to declare it as the 
following example:

```dart
JsonParser parser = new JsonParser();
List instance = parser.parseJson<DataClass>(json);
```

After the whole parsing process, `instance`  will contain all the values from
your json input.
