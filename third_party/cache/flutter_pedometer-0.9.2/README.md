# Flutter Pedometer

This plugin allows for conitnuous step count using the built-in pedometer sensor API's of iOS and Android devices.

## Usage

To use this plugin, add `flutter_pedometer` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/).

### Example

``` dart
import 'dart:async';
import 'package:flutter_pedometer/flutter_pedometer.dart';

class someClass {
    StreamSubscription<int> _subscription;
    FlutterPedometer pedometer;
    
    void someFunction() async {
        // ...
        pedometer = new FlutterPedometer();
        _subscription = pedometer.stepCountStream.listen(_onData,
            onError: _onError, onDone: _onDone, cancelOnError: true);
    }
    
    void _onData(int stepCountValue) async {
        // Do something with the stepCountValue
    }
    
    void _onDone() {
        // Do something when done collecting
    }
    
    void _onError(error) {
        // Handle the error
    }

}
        
```
## Configuring XCode for usage on iOS

It seems that users of this plug-in will have to manually open XCode and configure a few settings manually, mostly pertaining to privacy settings and permissions due to the application collecting the user's movement data.

For usage on Android it seems there are no problems with permissions.
