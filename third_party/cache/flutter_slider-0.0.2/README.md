# What is it?

~~Sample project for creating nice looking PageView parallax effects in Flutter.~~ 
I borrowed for personal use, but could really fix to some use cases where u want to resize the 'Slider' dimensions, where i exposed some inner states of it, and also making it clickable

original source: https://github.com/FlutterRocks/page-transformer

Goals: 
1) trying to do dots below, like [this](https://gist.github.com/collinjackson/4fddbfa2830ea3ac033e34622f278824)
2) make it auto play, maybe like [this repo](https://github.com/theobouwman/flutter_image_carousel)
3) add clicking listeners so that on clicking it, will invoke some function with the item passed as parameter

[Read the blogpost here](https://flutter.rocks/2017/09/23/bringing-the-pagetransformer-from-android-to-flutter/).

All the related source code is located in [the /lib folder](https://github.com/FlutterRocks/page-transformer/tree/master/lib); no separate Android / iOS code needed.



The end result looks a little something like this: (copied)
