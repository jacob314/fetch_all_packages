## [0.1.69] - 7th December, 2018

## [0.1.63] - 22nd November, 2018

## [0.1.62] - 22nd November, 2018

* Data mock can be stored in assets/data/<API_URL_AS_PATH_SEPARATED_BY_HYPHEN>-<METHOD>.json file

  For example:
    ```
    Network Provider(Online) calls GET '/api/v1/items',
    Using Offline provider one can mock the data by creating '/assets/data/api-v1-items-get.json'
    (or)
    Network Provider(Online) calls DELETE '/api/v1/items/1',
    Using Offline provider one can mock the data by creating '/assets/data/api-v1-items-1-delete.json'
    (or)
    Network Provider(Online) calls PUT '/api/v1/items/?status=available',
    Using Offline provider one can mock the data by creating '/api/v1/items--status=available'
    ```
  Note that `/` and `?` will eb replaced by `-`.
  This behavior can be overridden by overriding OfflineProvider and configuring the same on Config class

## [0.1.61] - 22nd November, 2018

* expanding network provider to an abstract classes data provider
 and 2 implementation classes network and offline

* Offline provider can be helpful for data mocking in development
  Data mock can be stored in assets/data/<API_URL_AS_PATH>/<METHOD>.json file

  For example:
  ```
  Network Provider(Online) calls GET '/api/v1/items',
  Using Offline provider one can mock the data by creating '/assets/data/api/v1/items/get.json'
  (or)
  Network Provider(Online) calls DELETE '/api/v1/items/1',
  Using Offline provider one can mock the data by creating '/assets/data/api/v1/items/1/delete.json'
  ```

  Note that method name must be lowercase
  Offline provider greatly helps in integrated testing with data
